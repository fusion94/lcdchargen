LCDCHARGEN
==========

#### Description
The LCD Character Generator (LCDCHARGEN) is a custom character generator to use with LCD Panels and/or LCD Shields.

This was originally developed by [Omerk Kilic](https://github.com/omerk/lcdchargen) but now is powered by my fork located [here](https://github.com/fusion94/lcdchargen).
  
This has been tested to work with the [LCD Keypad Shield For Arduino](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=51#.UQvN06HDS0c) by [DFRobot](http://dfrobot.com).

Other 16x2 LCD Panels/Shields should also work.
